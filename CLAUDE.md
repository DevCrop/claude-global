# claude-global

Source of truth for the global Claude Code setup. `claude/` is copied into `~/.claude` by `bash scripts/apply.sh`. Edit `claude/`, never `~/.claude` directly.

## Commands
- Apply: `bash scripts/apply.sh` (backs up first, touches only CLAUDE.md, RTK.md, settings.json, agents/, routines/).
- Check deny rules on this machine: `bash scripts/qa-deny.sh` (needs the claude CLI, uses haiku). Run it after any change to `permissions.deny` or hooks, and on every machine where RTK is installed.
- Syntax: `bash -n scripts/*.sh` and `python3 -c "import json;json.load(open('claude/settings.json'))"`.

## Rules
- Permission rules are evaluated on the input a PreToolUse hook returns. RTK rewrites `git ...` to `rtk git ...`, so every Bash deny pattern has an `rtk `-prefixed copy. Add both when you add a pattern.
- Keep `claude/CLAUDE.md` under 200 lines and free of lines that deny rules, settings, or `RTK.md` already cover.
- Never commit `reports/`, credentials, or `.env*`. `state/` holds the daily routine's per-machine baseline and is gitignored, so it never blocks `git pull` and values from one machine never mix with another.
- Changes go through a branch and a PR, and a person merges. Decisions and history are in `docs/NEXT-MACHINE.md`.
