description: Use when splitting work across subagents, before delegating to a role agent (publisher, frontend, backend, qa), explorer, worker or reviewer, or when deciding whether to delegate at all.
---

Default to one agent. Delegate only when the part does not block the main thread's next step, or its output is large and mostly irrelevant to it. Otherwise work inline.

1. Split by context and file ownership, not by job title. Roles that depend on each other in sequence and need the user (기획, 디자인) stay in the main thread: skills `spec-writing`, then `design-spec`. Delegate only parts that own different files.
2. Route by what the part touches:

   | Part | Agent |
   |---|---|
   | Static markup, CSS, templates | `publisher` |
   | Client logic, state, API calls | `frontend` |
   | Server code, API, database | `backend` |
   | Run it and check behavior | `qa` |
   | Diff against written criteria | `reviewer` |
   | One search question | `explorer` |
   | A change no role above fits | `worker` |

3. Usual order: spec, design, then `backend` and `publisher` together, then `frontend` (it needs the backend's API contract from its Open issues), then `qa`, then `reviewer`.
4. A delegate does not see this conversation. Brief it with: Task (one sentence), Files (paths it needs, the spec and design paths, the API contract), Return format, Done criteria (checkable by a command or a file read), Out of scope.
5. At most 3 delegates at once, and no two may edit the same file. Each owns one unit: a feature slice with its tests, one search question, or one verification.
6. Give `qa` and `reviewer` the criteria and the changed file list only, never the author's reasoning or a verdict to confirm.
7. A delegate's report is a claim. Check the evidence it cites before relaying it as done.
8. High-volume, well-defined subagent tasks run on Haiku.
