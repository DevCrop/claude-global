# Setup guide

End-to-end order for a machine and a project. Sources: Claude Code docs (best-practices, memory, skills, plugins, permissions). Decisions and history: `docs/NEXT-MACHINE.md`.

## Layers

| Layer | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Always on, every machine | RTK hook, Ponytail plugin, permissions (deny and ask rules, default mode bypassPermissions), `secret-guard` hook, short global `CLAUDE.md`, status line, agents `explorer` `reviewer` `worker` `publisher` `frontend` `backend` `qa`, daily routine | this repo, applied to `~/.claude` |
| On demand | skill `orchestrate` (description match, or `/orchestrate`), skills `spec-writing` and `design-spec` (planning and design in the main thread), skill `project-setup` (manual, `/project-setup`), Superpowers plugin in project or local scope only, AO as an external app | skills, plugin scope, the user |
| Per project, once | project `CLAUDE.md`, path-scoped rules, verification command, project permissions | the project's `.claude/` |

Never install Superpowers at user scope: an enabled plugin is part of every session, and its SessionStart hook injects the bootstrap each time (plugins doc).

## 0. Machine prerequisites (once per machine)

Needed: `git`, `jq` (status line), `node` (Ponytail hooks), `gh`, `rtk`, current Claude Code. On Windows use Git Bash.

```
echo ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}
claude --version
command -v rtk jq node gh
```

Done when every command prints a value. No path is hard-coded anywhere; only the clone location of this repo differs per machine.

## 1. Apply the global setup (each machine)

```
git pull
bash scripts/apply.sh            # backs up first, copies the items listed in apply.sh
claude plugin marketplace add DietrichGebert/ponytail
claude plugin install ponytail@ponytail
```

Open a new session (running sessions do not get the plugin), then verify:

```
bash scripts/verify.sh --live    # repo checks + applied files equal claude/ + tools + Ponytail
bash scripts/verify.sh --full    # also runs qa-deny.sh (claude CLI + haiku); run it where RTK is installed
```

Done when `verify.sh --live` prints `0 FAIL`. WARN lines are informational (for example no `.ponytail-active` flag before the first new session). Then spot-check by hand: `rtk gain` total commands grows after a few Bash calls, the status line shows `[model] N% context`, `/context` lists the global `CLAUDE.md`, and `claude plugin details ponytail` shows its always-on token cost.

Undo: copy files back from `~/.claude-backup-<timestamp>/`.

## 2. Bootstrap a project (once, before the first task)

Run `/project-setup` in the project directory (manual-only skill). It reads manifests, CI workflows and lint configs, finds the verification command per area, and proposes `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md` and `.claude/settings.json` as files for you to approve. It installs nothing and invents no commands; what it cannot confirm is listed under "Not verified". Under the bypass default there is no permission prompt for writes, so the skill's own step 10 (an explicit yes in chat) is the approval.

What to check afterwards:
1. `CLAUDE.md` is under 200 lines and every line would cause a mistake if removed (`/doctor` proposes cuts).
2. The verification commands are the ones CI or the scripts really run. For markup and CSS with no automated check, decide on a screenshot comparison or a lint and write it down; without a check Claude can run, "done" is only its own opinion.
3. Path-scoped rules use the documented frontmatter, a YAML `paths:` list (the only field Claude Code reads in a rule).
4. Permissions: `deny` repeats the global `.env*` and credentials rules on purpose (cloud sessions and teammates do not read `~/.claude`); `allow` lists only read-only check commands and is inert locally under the global bypass default; each Bash rule has its `rtk ` twin where RTK is installed. No `defaultMode`.
   Also pick how hard the check gates the work (prompt line, `/goal`, Stop hook, reviewer subagent; the skill asks) and add `CLAUDE.local.md` and `.claude/settings.local.json` to the project `.gitignore`.
   Projects that share `AGENTS.md` with Codex: `AGENTS.md` stays the source and the skill never edits it. With no `CLAUDE.md`, Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` itself, so the skill adds only `.claude/` files; a `CLAUDE.md` it creates must start with `@AGENTS.md` (a `CLAUDE.md` without the import makes Claude stop reading `AGENTS.md`; use the import, not a symlink, on Windows).
5. Feature-development projects only: `claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official --scope local` (`--scope project` shares it; each collaborator installs it themselves). Skip it for markup-only or small-fix projects. Not user scope.
6. In a new session: `/context` shows the project `CLAUDE.md`, `/hooks` lists only intended hooks.

## 3. Per task

| Work | Flow |
|---|---|
| Markup, small fix | Ask directly, verify with the check, commit |
| Bug | Give symptom, location and what "fixed" means; reproduce with a failing check; fix; verify |
| Feature, medium | Plan mode (Shift+Tab), approve the plan, implement, verify |
| Feature, large | Let Claude interview you (`AskUserQuestion`), write `SPEC.md`, implement in a fresh session |
| Review | Fresh-context `reviewer` or `/code-review`; only findings that affect correctness or the stated requirements |
| Parallel | Git worktrees; AO is optional. Workers per non-overlapping file area with tests as the done criterion, then an AO review per PR; measured once on a disposable repo (`docs/NEXT-MACHINE.md`, "AO QA 실측") |

Habits: `/clear` between unrelated tasks; after two failed corrections on one issue, `/clear` and restate the task; `/rewind` to undo; changes go through a branch and a PR and a person merges.

## 4. Daily routine and maintenance

- The routine `daily-claude-update` runs `claude --version`, the changelog, `scripts/verify.sh --live`, and `scripts/docs-watch.sh` (eight official docs pages this setup depends on), then writes `reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and proposes changes. It only reads and reports. Steps live in `claude/routines/daily-update.md` and are read from the clone, so `git pull` updates them.
- On each machine create the scheduled task in the app once, from the pointer body in `claude/scheduled-tasks/daily-claude-update/SKILL.md` (replace `<repo>` with that machine's clone path). If the app still holds the older body with the full list of steps, replace it with the pointer body.
- Monthly: `/doctor` on `CLAUDE.md`, skills and agents.
- After any change to permissions or hooks: `bash scripts/verify.sh --full` on every machine where RTK is installed.
- Edit `claude/` in this repo, never `~/.claude` directly.

## Live dashboard

`python3 scripts/dashboard/server.py` serves http://127.0.0.1:8787 (local only, read-only, standard library). It refreshes every 3 seconds and shows the workflow state (edit, PR, merge, apply, verify, routine, report), tool calls per minute and a tool log from the newest session log in `~/.claude/projects` (tool names, times and file basenames only, never message text), commit and PR history, the `verify.sh --live` output and the latest routine report. `verify.sh --live` runs at most once a minute. Visual direction: Claude Code's terminal look (one monospace face, warm near-black canvas, one Claude-orange accent, state shown as badges). The face is whatever monospace the machine has; Claude Code's own font is the terminal's. Not measured: other operating systems (on Windows the server picks Git Bash for `verify.sh`) and logs of sessions that run on another machine.

## Permission mode: bypassPermissions by default

The default mode is `bypassPermissions` (decision 2026-10-10). Per the permission-modes doc, deny rules apply in every mode including bypass, explicit ask rules and `rm`/`rmdir` on critical paths still prompt, and allow rules have no effect. So `permissions.deny` and `permissions.ask` in `claude/settings.json` are the guard. `verify.sh` fails when `defaultMode` is not `bypassPermissions`, when a bypass lock is present, or when `deny` or `ask` is missing or empty.

- `defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"` takes effect only from user settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`, written by `apply.sh`), not from a project `.claude/settings.json`. Claude Desktop also needs the "Allow bypass permissions mode" toggle.
- An AO worker started with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` falls under the same deny and ask rules. This is the documented behavior. In a bypass session on this machine, deny rules blocked a `.env` read and a force push (2026-10-10, see `docs/NEXT-MACHINE.md`); an AO worker with `ao project set-config <id> --permission bypass-permissions` showed `bypass permissions on`, was blocked on the same force push by the deny rule, and stopped at the ask rules for `git push *` and `rm *` (2026-10-10). Without that setting the worker ran in Auto mode. The `.env` block by a worker is not measured.
- To go back to prompts, change `permissions.defaultMode` in `claude/settings.json` and the check in `scripts/verify.sh` in one PR, then run `bash scripts/apply.sh`.

## Secret-guard hook

`claude/hooks/secret-guard.sh` runs before every Bash call (PreToolUse; exit 2 blocks, per the hooks doc). Calls without `git` plus `add`, `stage`, `commit` or `push` pass at once. Otherwise it blocks when a secret-looking name would be staged, committed or pushed: `.credentials*`, `.env`, `.env.*`, `.claude.json`, `history.jsonl`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa*`; names ending in `.example`, `.sample`, `.template` and `id_rsa*.pub` are allowed. It also catches an `rtk ` prefix, `-C dir`, `cd dir &&`, quotes, `bash -c`, `git stage` and globals such as `--no-pager`. A blocked call prints the file names; fix it by removing them from the change or adding them to `.gitignore`. To turn it off, remove its entry from `claude/settings.json` in a PR and run `bash scripts/apply.sh`.

Limit: it reads the command text. Aliases, scripts that call git, variables, `xargs`/`find -exec`, paths with spaces, brace expansion and `eval` are not seen (a reviewer found these on 2026-10-10), and it has no timeout of its own, so a huge repository can make it slow, so it is a guard rail, not a boundary. The daily routine's repository exposure check (step 7b) covers what reaches a public repository anyway. Tests: `bash scripts/qa-hooks.sh` (also run by `verify.sh`).

## AO (Orchestrator.inc) use

Use AO only for parallel work with disjoint file scopes. Set permissions with `ao project set-config <id> --permission ...` (it replaces the whole config: round-trip `ao project get --json` first), put the done criteria and "never push" in `--agent-rules`, and push and merge by hand. Killing a worker session empties its worktree and blocks review, so trigger `ao review trigger` before ending it, or re-register the repository and use `--claim-pr`. Measured behavior and traps: `docs/NEXT-MACHINE.md` section 13.

## Not verified

- Windows Git Bash and macOS behavior of `apply.sh`, `verify.sh`, the plugin hooks and `qa-deny.sh` with the real RTK hook (tested on Linux without RTK).
- The `claude plugin list` output format that `verify.sh` parses for the Ponytail status; a changed format shows up as a WARN, not a false PASS.
- Superpowers' hook on Windows Git Bash, and how often `orchestrate` is loaded by description matching (`/orchestrate` is the fallback).
- `secret-guard`: macOS bash 3.2 and BSD `sed`/`tr` behavior, hook latency, and running next to the real RTK hook (checked with RTK-less project settings in `bypassPermissions`: `git add -A` was blocked).
- `project-setup` was dry-run once on a scratch PHP + React project; the interactive approval flow and real projects are untested.

## Deliberately not adopted

User-scope Superpowers, agent teams (experimental), agent view (research preview), hook-based intent detection, a global Stop hook or `/goal` gate (enable per project once it has tests), a daily proposal loop that mines session logs.
