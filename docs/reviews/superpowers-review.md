# Review: obra/superpowers v6.4.2

Source: https://github.com/obra/superpowers @ 8ca22db (2026-09-25).
Read: README, `using-superpowers`, `brainstorming`, `test-driven-development`, `hooks/session-start`, `AGENTS.md`.
Not read: remaining skills, `tests/` execution results. The external eval harness (`superpowers-evals`) was not inspected, so effectiveness claims are unverified.

## Verdict

Ship with fixes. For this setup (vanilla compliance): do not install the full plugin; cherry-pick selectively.

## Strongest counter-case

Official marketplace listing, `tests/`, an external eval harness, and design history under `docs/superpowers/specs` show this is not an unverified prompt pile. Eval results are not in the repo, so they could not be checked.

## Issues

- [risk] Constant context cost: the SessionStart hook (`startup|clear|compact`) injects `using-superpowers` (~490 words) every time; 15 skill descriptions are always loaded. Bodies total ~25k words; triggered skills load whole (`subagent-driven-development` 4.8k, `writing-skills` 3.8k, `executing-plans` 3.2k).
- [risk] Over-triggering by design: `EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT`, "1% chance -> MUST invoke", skill check before clarifying questions; `brainstorming` description says "You MUST use this before any creative work". Conflicts with a "skip for trivial edits" policy.
- [risk] TDD iron law ("NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST", delete code written first) is unenforceable in infra, config, or legacy PHP without a test harness; invites workarounds or token tests. Exceptions require asking the human.
- [smell] Skill text is adversarial prompting (rationalization tables, "violating the letter is violating the spirit"). Behavior is likely model-version sensitive; regression coverage depends on the author's private evals.
- [smell] `AGENTS.md` rejects Anthropic's published skill-writing guidance in favor of unpublished internal evals. Opposite of working from official docs.
- [smell] 16 harness adapters (`.cursor-plugin`, `.kimi-plugin`, `.hermes-plugin`, `.muse-plugin`, ...) and env-var branching in `hooks/session-start`. Dead surface for a Claude-Code-only user; workaround for bash 5.3 heredoc hang (#571) remains in code.
- [risk] Telemetry: brainstorming's visual companion loads a logo from the vendor site with the Superpowers version (default on). Opt-outs: `SUPERPOWERS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`. Per the README it sends no project data; not verified in code.
- [taste] `writing-plans` assumes a "junior engineer with no judgement"; plans and per-task subagent reviews are token-heavy by default (v6.4.2 trimmed plans).

## What works

- `brainstorming` HARD-GATE: approval applies only to the stage actually presented; idea approval does not imply spec or plan approval.
- `verification-before-completion` (556 words) and `requesting-code-review` (422 words) are small and overlap the existing "real check before done" preference.
- `systematic-debugging`: no fix before root cause; matches "failing test first".

## Decision for claude-global (2026-10-09)

Work mix: markup/CSS, frontend, backend, reviews. Superpowers fits feature development with ambiguous requirements; it adds cost and friction for markup and small fixes. The small skills (verification, debugging, review) duplicate rules already in user preferences and `claude/CLAUDE.md`.

- Not installed at user scope. An enabled plugin is in every session (names and descriptions of its skills every turn, hooks at their events), and this plugin's SessionStart hook injects the bootstrap each time (Claude Code plugins doc).
- Installed per project, only for feature-development repositories: `claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official --scope local` (`--scope project` shares it; each collaborator installs it themselves).
- Cost can be read before and after: `claude plugin details superpowers` shows the always-on token count.
- Before keeping it in a project, run one real task with and without it and compare cost and rework (one sample proves little, as with Ponytail).
- Orchestration rules live in the `orchestrate` skill and `project-setup` bootstraps projects; neither depends on Superpowers.

## Open

Whether the comparison above shows a benefit on a real feature task.
